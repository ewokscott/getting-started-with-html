  <b><p>Notes from Stage 0</b></p>
<b>Basics:-</b>
<br>
We use a language called HTML to write web pages. HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>.
<br>
We use a protocol called HTTP to transfer web pages to our browser. HTTP stands for <em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</em>
<br>
The WWW <em>(World Wide Web)</em> was invented in 1990 and has around 30 Billion pages
<br>
<br><b>Some HTML we learned about:-<br></b>
<em>Anchors</em>:- Used to insert links into web pages
<br>
<em>Void Tags</em>:- A tag with no closing tag such as "br"
<br>
<em>Inline tags</em>:- Tags that are displayed "inline" on the web page, such as "em"
<br>
<em>Block tags</em>:- Tags that have a shape that forms a box around the content, such as "p"
<br>
